# Garbage_classification
It is the process of categorizing waste into different types, such as recyclable (paper, glass, metal, plastic), organic (food scraps, yard waste), hazardous (batteries, paint, e-waste), and non-hazardous. Proper classification is essential for effective waste management, recycling, and to ensure hazardous materials are handled safely.
